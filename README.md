Overview

This project was developed as part of an internship at Code Casa. The Digital Clock Web Application is a simple yet elegant implementation of a digital clock that can be embedded on any website. It displays the current time in a clear and easily readable format, making it a useful addition to any web page. The application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing my proficiency in front-end web development. 

Technologies Used
HTML5 for structuring the page content
CSS3 for styling and layout design
